# **App Name**: CodeZero

## Core Features:

- Code Editor: A Monaco-editor-based multi-language code editor with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and real-time error checking.
- Compiler Selection: Allows the user to select a language (Python, Java, C++, C).
- Code Compilation: Compile and run code snippets directly in the browser. Generative AI "tool" assesses the selected language, generates execution steps appropriate to the language and executes those steps; it then handles language-specific error-reporting.
- Output Display: Displays the output/errors in a panel below the code editor.
- Themes: Allow users to choose from multiple pre-defined editor themes (light, dark, etc.).
- Download Code: Ability to download the written code in the selected language file format.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#3498db) to create a professional, focused environment.
- Background color: Dark Gray (#2c3e50) for reduced eye strain during long coding sessions.
- Accent color: Teal (#1abc9c) for important actions like compile/run to draw the user's attention.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for clear and modern readability.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro', a monospaced font to improve the readability of code segments.
- Simple, line-based icons for actions and language selection.
- Subtle animations for the compile/run actions, with a loading indicator while compiling.
